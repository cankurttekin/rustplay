# Cargo
rust's build system and package manager. builds the code, download libraries...

## Creating a project with Cargo
cargo new hello_cargo
    generates Cargo.toml file and src dir with main.rs file inside.
    inits new git repo
TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) Cargo config.
Packages of code are referred to as creates.

cargo init creates Cargo.toml in existing nonCargo rust project.

## Build&run cargo project
cargo build
./target/debug/project_name
or cargo run compile and runs

cargo check: checks code and makes sure it compiles (doesnt produce an exec.)

## Building for Release
cargo build --release
compiles with optimizations. exec. in target/release
